# **From Prototype to 2,000 Customers**

## **Designing construction management software that works**

Toolkit needed product design to secure funding and reach market fit in construction tech. Over 12 months, I led end-to-end design in a lean CEO-Dev-Designer team with continuous user validation. We shipped three major releases: funding prototype (3 months), feature-rich V2 (5 months), and mobile-optimized V3 (4 months). The product reached 2,000 paying customers within 24 months, secured enterprise adoption at launch, and raised Series A funding in November 2025

*Victor worked with Toolkit as our UX/UI designer from the earliest stages. We ran discovery workshops together before even building the product, allowing him to deeply understand the construction industry. He transformed complex business requirements into perfectly adapted user flows, exactly what a startup like ours needed. Thanks to his experience, Victor also established foundational systems (UI kit, interaction patterns) that saved us considerable development time down the line. Beyond his craft skills, Victor brings intellectual curiosity, consistent optimism, and the willingness to challenge assumptions to push thinking further. That's why our collaboration has continued for two years and will extend well into the future.*

# Overview

---

## Introduction

Construction software is overwhelming. Legacy tools pack every feature into dense interfaces, forcing users through complex workflows to complete basic tasks. Site managers juggle multiple projects, field workers need quick status updates, and office teams require detailed planning. One interface cannot serve all needs equally.

Toolkit approached this differently. Rather than building another feature-complete solution, we focused on core workflows that construction teams use daily: planning tasks across zones, tracking progress, managing documents, coordinating teams. The challenge was delivering sophistication without complexity.

## My role

I joined as sole designer in a three-person team. The CEO brought domain expertise from years researching construction workflows. The lead developer built the technical foundation. My role: transform business requirements into a scalable product that users would actually adopt. No design team, no researchers, no product managers. Just tight collaboration, continuous validation, and rapid iteration.

## Project and impact

Over 12 months, we evolved from funding prototype to platform maturity. Each phase added sophistication while maintaining simplicity. Progressive disclosure hid complexity until needed. Context-aware interfaces adapted to user tasks. Batch operations reduced repetitive actions. Visual hierarchy prevented information overload at scale.

The approach worked. Enterprise customers deployed at launch. Users managing 15+ construction sites adopted the platform. The product reached 2,000 paying customers in 24 months and secured Series A funding. This case study shows how we got there.

# Context and approach

Three phases from funding prototype to platform maturity. Phase 1 secured initial funding with core features. Phase 2 added sophisticated interactions and multi-project support. Phase 3 achieved mobile optimization and design system scalability. Result: 2,000 customers, enterprise adoption, Series A funding within 24 months.

### Core Design Challenge

![**Core Design Challenge** - Planning interface showing the fundamental tension: construction projects contain 50-100+ tasks across multiple zones and timelines. Visual density, information hierarchy, and scalability all compete. Design working for 10 tasks becomes overwhelming at 50. The challenge: maintain clarity at scale without sacrificing depth.](Toolkit/Diagram_01_-_Problem.svg)

### Product Creation Workflow

![Four-step process from project basics to team launch. Progressive disclosure design: setup steps prominent during creation, automatically collapse in secondary menu once project active.

### Core Interaction Principles

![Design principles preventing feature bloat as product expanded. Progressive disclosure: reveal complexity only when needed. Context awareness: interface adapts to current task. Batch efficiency: multi-select and group operations reduce repetition. Visual hierarchy: layer information by importance. Applied consistently across features, principles maintained simplicity at scale.](Toolkit/Diagram_05_-_Core_interaction_principles.svg)

# Phase 1 - Foundation

## 1st time experience

![**Passwordless authentication via magic link**. Users enter email, receive secure link, click to access. No passwords to remember, create, or reset. Eliminates common friction point in construction software where field workers share devices and forget credentials. One-click access reduces support requests and improves adoption on construction sites.](Toolkit/authentication_-_magic_link.svg)
