                bio: "Great products are rarely built in isolation. They are the result of rigorous collaboration between design, engineering, and product management. My background in Art Direction gave me an eye for detail, but 15 years in the field taught me that the real work happens in the trenches—solving edge cases with developers and iterating based on real-world usage.\n\nI have led design through massive pivots at scale-ups like UNOWHY and Dailymotion, and helped launch new ventures like Toolkit. I believe in leadership that empowers designers to be strategic partners. Whether I'm defining a 2-year roadmap with a CPO or fixing a CSS bug with a junior dev, I bring the same level of care and pragmatism.",

                        { heading: "3. The Planning Engine", text: "The heart of Toolkit is the Gantt planning view.
